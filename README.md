# Blog It - A Simple API-Fetching Flutter Application

## Overview
**Blog It** is a Flutter application that fetches and displays data from an external API. It demonstrates essential Flutter development skills such as API integration, state management, asynchronous operations, and UI updates. The app also uses Firebase for backend functionalities and is designed with scalability in mind for future enhancements.

## Features
- Fetches data from a public API (**https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts**).
- Displays post titles in a scrollable **ListView**.
- Implements a **CircularProgressIndicator** for a seamless user experience.
- Handles API errors gracefully by showing appropriate error messages.
- Uses Firebase for backend integration (authentication, database, and storage support).
- Clean and structured code following best practices.

## Project Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Firebase project set up with necessary configurations

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/blog-it.git
   cd blog-it
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. **Configure Firebase**
   - Download the `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) from your Firebase console.
   - Place them in the appropriate directories:
     - `android/app/google-services.json`
     - `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
4. **Run the application**
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```

## API Integration
- The app fetches data from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) using the `http` package.
- Data is retrieved asynchronously and displayed in a **ListView**.
- A **CircularProgressIndicator** is shown while data is being fetched.
- Errors are handled to provide a smooth user experience.

## Future Enhancements
- **Better Code Architecture**: Implementing a more modular approach using Provider or Riverpod for state management.
- **Add More Screens**: Expanding functionalities such as post details, user profiles, and comments.
- **Enhance UI and User Experience**: Improving design, animations, and navigation for a more intuitive interface.

## Requirements Evaluated in this Assignment
This project is designed to assess Flutter development skills with a focus on:
- **API integration and handling HTTP requests** using the `http` package.
- **Displaying data efficiently in a ListView**.
- **Managing asynchronous operations effectively** using FutureBuilder and state management techniques.
- **Implementing loading indicators** for improved user experience.
- **Handling errors gracefully** to ensure a user-friendly interface.
- **Maintaining clean and well-structured code** following Flutter best practices.
